Everything relatex to token management DONE
-Keep track of tokens on grapevine DONE
-deal with revokation DONE
-add appropriate code to client to ask for them DONE
Handle the "complicated case" of reading and writing across multiple blocks DONE
Figure out how to flush to server when client is finished. (did it via pfs_close) DONE
Write fstat DONE
write delete DONE
add who i am to get_servers DONE
keep clients array in grapevine DONE
add logic to give a read token if you get a write token DONE
Call flusher thread (have an idea for this, actually all of the code for this is written we are just missing one line. DONE

Write report

future todo:
Retry logic
multi thread read / write (shouldn't be too hard)


modification time, and push to server TODO
last read / last write (for token resolution logic) TODO
add ability to get stat after opening... TODO
keep track of partial block size TODO
add command to grapevine to keep track of exact size TODO
check if client can read / write a file on client side TODO
Call harvester thread TODO
deal with stale stat entries TODO
deal with stripe width / stripe size (on piazza) (not quite) robin server assignment TODO
actually use CLIENT_CACHE_SIZE

WHY THE FUCK ISNT REVOKE BLOCKING...

make magic numbers #defines


test cases:
simultaneous reads DONE
read / write REVOKE token DONE
write then read DONE
Cache hit on write then read on same client DONE


write 4k (last_write = 3?) then sleep for 10
read @ block1
